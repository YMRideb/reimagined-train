/*
Separation of concerns

Components only need to be concerned with receiving and rendering data,
they do not need to be concerned with how to make API calls

This service file is concerned with only how to make API calls to our API
and only returns the data

Combining a service file with the react-query package's useQuery hook 
is ideal for larger projects
